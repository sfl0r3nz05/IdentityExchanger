## Introduction

The Identity Exchange (IE) is an entity that acts as Broker Identity Federation that implement one time blind Proof of Existence (PoE) that establish that a real person is behind an account without reveling sensible user information. IE also use Proof of Attributes (PoA) to enable specific verification as part of the claims. As shown in the following figure, the entities that form part of the system are:

- User
- Identity Provider (IdP)
- Identity Exchange (IE)
- Relying Party (RP)

## Functional Requirements

1. **Setting up a trust chain**:

    - The IE must support different RP levels of assurances.
    - IE negotiate Identity Assurance Level and Authenticator Assurance with RP.
    - IE negotiate Federation Assurance Level with IdP.

2. **Integration on the consent banner**:

   - The IE access entry point is the consent banner that must be previously installed in the RP.
   - The user interface contained into the consent banner will directly display the IdPs supported by IE.

3. **Approach of information flow**

- As shown in the following figure, the IE is internally divided into an OIDC Provider to establish communication with the RP's OIDC client and an OIDC client to establish communication with the IdP. Taking this approach into consideration, the following information flows are defined as follows:

   ![Indentity Exchange in detail](./images/IE_detail.png)

   1. The user discovers a relying party.
      1. The user access the RP with the intent to create an account and access services on the RP.
   2. The user creates an account on the RP and as the last step of account creation, the RP asks for access to identity information from a user through a trusted IE.
      1. The RP acting as the client, creates an authentication request including the scope parameters which includes any attributes requested, proof of attributes requested and the Level of Assurance (LoA) requirements. The authentication request includes:
         1. A redirect response created by the client, which triggers the user agent to make an authentication request to the OpenID Provider (OP) which is the IE in this context.
         2. This authentication request includes a client_id which is the client identifier, the scope , the redirect_uri where the client will receive the authentication response, the state which is a random string generated by the client to identify a session, prevent CSRF attacks and must be returned to the client in the authentication response, and other optional specifications.
   3. The IE logs the request from the RP and stores it against an identifier that it creates called the RP Link. The IE also validates the authentication request from the RP.
      1. This RP Link will be used to connect the information requested by the RP to the information provided by the IdP without either party knowing the identity of each other.
      2. The IE prompts the user to select an IdP. The user selects an IdP.
   4. Based on the selected IdP, the IE creates a Authentication Request for the selected IdP. Now the Exchange acts as a client and the IdP will be the OP. The IE will use all the information provided by the RP to create the scope . The authentication request includes:
      1. A redirect response created by the client (the IE now), which triggers the user agent to make an authentication request to the OpenID Provider (OP) which is the IdP now.
      2. This authentication request includes a `client_id` which is the client identifier (identifies the IE), the `scope`, the `redirect_uri` where the client will receive the authentication response, the state which is a random string generated by the client to identify a session, prevent CSRF attacks and must be returned to the client in the authentication response, and other optional specifications.
   5. The IdP validates that the authentication request came from the IE.
   6. The IdP prompts user to log into their account. The user provides necessary credentials to access their account on the IdP.
      1. There might be extra steps required for the user to satisfy the LoA requirements. These requirements will be specified in the `scope` of the authentication request. The Identity Assurance Level (IAL) or the Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) might not be satisfied. The user will be required to meet the requirement levels by identity proofing mechanisms or adding multi-factor authentication to their IdP.
   7. An authentication response is returned to the client (the IE) which includes a code generated by the OP (the IdP) and the same `state` value provided by the client in the Authentication request in step 4.
      1. The authorization code called code is a random string issued by the IdP to be used in the request to the token endpoint - this is an endpoint at the OP (which in this step is the IdP). The OIDC has many code flows, for the purpose of this architecture I am using the Authorization code flow. The authorization code flow ensures that none of the tokens are exposed to the User Agent which removes the chance of any malicious applications on the User Agent being able to access the tokens.
   8. The IE validates the authentication response.
   9. Now, the IE creates a Token request which includes the `code` that was received in the authentication response in step 7, the `redirect_uri` which must match the value used in the authentication request in step 4, and the `client_assertion` which is the the signed client authentication JWT generated by the client(IE). The client must generate a new assertion JWT for each call to the token endpoint at the IdP.
      1. The signed JWT is a Json Web Token which has claims made by the IE and signed by it as well. These claims include `iss` which is the client ID of the client creating and issuing the JWT, the `aud` which is the URL of the OP’s (which is the IdP in this step) token endpoint, the `jti` which is a unique random identifier of the JWT and the date of creation and expiration.
   10. The IdP validates the Token request. The Token request is accepted when signature on the JWT (`client_assertion`) is validated using the IE’s registered public key.
   11. The OP (IdP) returns a Token Response which includes an ID Token and an Access Token, signed by the IdP.
       1. **ID Token**: It is the signed JWT which includes set of claims sent by the OP. These claims includes the `iss` which is the URL of the OP creating and issuing the ID Token, which is the IdP in this step, the `aud` which is client ID of the client (IE), the `sub` which is the identifier of the user, the `acr` which is the level of assurance at which the user was authenticated at, at the IdP, the `jti` which is a unique random identifier of the JWT to prevent reuse of token and the date of creation and expiration of the ID Token.
       2. The `sub` is a pairwise unique value which identifies the end-user of the OP to the client only. So a different Exchange will have a different value for the `sub` identifier for the same end-user. This is added to remove linkability if two clients collude (which in this case is two Exchanges).
       3. The ID Token may also include other requested claims (attributes and proof of attributes) such as the end user’s email address or a Boolean confirming whether the end-user is over the age of 18.
       4. **Access Token**: An Access token can be used to make further requests for more User Information. For the sake of this example, I assume the RP requires no excess identity attributes from the IdP.
   12. The IE validates the Token response. The IE validates the ID Token and accepts it if the signature on the ID Token is validated using IdP’s registered public key.
   13. The IE extracts the subject identifier(`sub`) from the ID Token and checks whether it already has a an entry for that particular subject identifier. If one doesn’t exist, The Identity Exchange creates one and stores it against an identifier generated by the Exchange called the *IdP link*.
       1. Just like the RP Link mentioned in step 3, the *IdP Link* will be used to connect information provided by an IdP to an RP.
   14. The IE extracts all other claims from the ID Token as well. Before passing on the attributes to the RP that requested them, the IE asks for user consent.
       1. The IE prompts the user to give consent. The user provides the necessary consent.
   15. The Authentication Response to the request created in step 2.1 is sent back to the client. Now the Exchange is back to acting as the OP and the RP will be the client. The response includes a code generated by the OP (the IE) and the same state value provided by the client in the Authentication request in step 2.1.
   16. The RP validates the Authentication response.
   17. The RP creates a Token Request to the IE. This request includes the ``code` , the `redirect_uri` used in the authentication request and the `client_assertion` which is the signed JWT generated by the client (RP).
   18. The IE validates the Token request. It also validates the signature on the JWT against the RP’s registered public key.
   19. The IE returns a successful Token response. This includes an ID Token and an Access Token signed by the IE. The ID Token includes all the information required by the RP in its initial request. The ID Token also contains the number of times this IdP has been used by the the end-user to create an account on the RP.
   20. The RP validates the Token response, as well as the ID Token and the JWT signed in the ID Token.
   21. The RP extracts all other claims from the ID Token as well. This includes identity attributes, proof of identity attributes (PoA), count of previous accounts on this RP and Levels of Assurance.
       1. The RP lets user know that account creation was successful if the previous count of accounts is less than the threshold created by the RP.
